What is the project? Could you introduce it for me?



* convention 会展

* **booth** 会展中的摊位

* bull market 牛市
* bear market 熊市



I haven't really been doing any crypto trading lately because the bear market is coming. I still hold some Bitcoin —— you know, you can't just sell everything at once.

You'v got to keep a bit in case it suddenly pumps.

But since the price has been dropping, i sold part of it and just stopped paying attention for now.

> 我最近都没有操作加密货币投资，因为熊市就要来了，我仍然持有一些比特币，你知道的，你不能一次性把他们都卖了，你总要持有一些防止万一暴涨。但是目前比特币价格下跌，我卖了一部分，就不关注了

> 价格下跌可以用go down，fall down有点摔落感，come down有房价跌回正常值的感觉



Back when Bitcoin once shot up to 120k, I was trading a lot. But not any more.

之前比特币一度冲到120k，那时候我交易得多，但是现在不行了

12w → 有4个0，120,000 → 120k → one twenty thousand口语化

# types of workouts 锻炼类型

* **Weight/strength training** – This type of workout builds muscle strength and size. It can include using weights, weight machines, or bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups.

* **HIIT**

  **(High-intensity interval training)** – This refers to workouts that focus on short bursts of intense exercise followed by quick rest periods. In a HIIT workout, you may perform jumping jacks, burpees, and sprints.

* **Aerobic** 有氧运动

  Aerobic workouts involve exercises that make your heart beat faster and your breathing increase. They help improve fitness and include walking, running, cycling, and swimming.

Terminology:

* warm up

* reps

  Short for repetitions, reps refer to the number of times you perform a specific exercise or movement. For example, if you do 10 push-ups, each push-up represents one repetition.

* **Sets**

  A set is a group of consecutive repetitions. When you perform a certain number of reps and then take a short rest, that’s considered 1 set. For instance, if you do 3 sets of 10 push-ups, you would do 10 push-ups, rest briefly, repeat 10 push-ups, rest again, and complete the final set of 10 push-ups.

* **Cool down**

  This is a period at the end of your workout designed to lower your heart rate, cool down your body temperature, and promote recovery. Cooling down activities include gentle stretching, walking, and deep breathing.

* Bench Press

  如果你是完全躺在长凳上，用杠铃从胸前向上推，就是标准卧推。

* **Captain’s Chair**
